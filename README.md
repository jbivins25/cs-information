Hello, world! 

This repository was created by Josh Bivins for the SSCS 2023 STEAM Expo. It is intended to be a leaping off point for students to get started within CS. There are a list of resources here, ranging from basic introductions for younger students to more advanced introductions and resources for older students. This is a working list that will be updated over time.

If there are any questions, reach out to the school for ways to contact me or leave a message in the issues section.

Best,
Josh
